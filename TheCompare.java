//Linear Search : The best case for linear search occurs when time complexity of O(1).
//        --Worst Case: The worst case for linear search occurs when time complexity of O(n)

//Binary Search:The best case for binary search occurs when the target element is found at the middle of the sorted list 
//time complexity of O(1)

//---Worst Case: The worst case for binary search occurs when 
//the target element is either at the beginning or end of the sorted list or not present in the list at all.
//time complexity for binary search is O(log n).
